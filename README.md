# Milk-Grading

Welcome to the Milk Quality Classification Project!

This project revolves around the development and deployment of a machine learning classification model designed to distinguish between good and bad milk samples based on various quality parameters. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we have created a robust model that achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 70%.

To ensure the efficacy of our model, we meticulously analyzed a dataset comprising 1060 milk samples. These samples were meticulously assessed on the basis of key parameters including pH, odor, turbidity, color, and taste. Through extensive analysis and iterative refinement, we have successfully created a reliable tool for quality control in the dairy industry.

Our aim with this project is to contribute to enhancing quality control processes within the dairy sector, thereby promoting consumer safety and satisfaction. Whether you're a researcher, data scientist, or industry professional, we invite you to explore our project and contribute to the advancement of milk quality assessment. Feel free to delve into our codebase, experiment with our model, and join us in our mission to ensure the provision of high-quality dairy products to consumers worldwide.
